# EEVDF Scheduler Simulator

This project is a simulator of the Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First
(EEVDF) scheduler and it is intended only for academic purposes to explain
how EEVDF scheduling works.

## Disclaimer

This implementation does not perfectly resemble the EEVDF algorithm as
described in the original paper. However, it provides a possible
implementation to demonstrate the logic behind EEVDF scheduling.

For a detailed description of EEVDF, please refer to the
[original paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=805acf7726282721504c8f00575d91ebfd750564).
